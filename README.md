<p style="color:#ffc0cb"><a href="https://coolconegames.w3spaces.com/index.html" style="color:#ffc0cb;">COOL_CONE_GAMES</a> is a free gaming website created in early 2025 by Teo Nacamulli Tabet. It features a large range of games(right now over 100!), everywhere from clickers to platformers to sports games, many of which are found by users! Teo N. Tabet started getting intrested in programming when he was around 8 years old, when he discovered the website <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" style="color:#ffc0cb;">Scratch&reg</a>. By age 10, he was invested in programming and had started the language <a href="https://www.python.org/" style="color:#ffc0cb;">Python&reg</a>. In December, 2024, he discovered html and website creation through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" style="color:#ffc0cb;">w3schools.com</a>. He started building this website in January 2024. It quickly became a bigger project, so he started to add CSS and Javascript attributes. Teo N. Tabet continues to make games and other programs. Thank you for playing!</p>
